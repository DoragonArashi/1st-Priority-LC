    <div class="box zone"><p>Katrina and Lonnie Brewer are the owners of 1st Priority Logistics & Consolidation. They have been married for 30 years and have 2 boys, Ethan 24, and Levi 21.</p>
      <p>Katrina grew up in Healdsburg, California. Then in 1989, at the age of 16, the family relocated to Washington.  Her roots never left California, and she was determined to move back from the start. Then she met Lonnie, and started a family. She has spent the last 20yrs building a flawless reputation in the wine industry. She is known by many as a the "go to girl" when something needs to be done, she will make it happen.  Her years in the business made it obvious that there is a huge need for specialized service. Katrina's experience and expertise in logistics and consolidation made it a "no brainer" to move back to California in 2012 and start 1st Priority.</p>
      <p>Lonnie is a native Washatonian. He was born in Spokane, Washington and at the age of 4 his family moved to Southwest Washington. He spent 20 years in the ALL aspects of the lumber industry, maintaining a flawless Class A CDL. In 2008, when the building industry went bottoms up, he found himself looking for a new career. The family joke was "Can we move to California?", asks the family, "Nope" he would say. After 2 yrs of searching for employment it came clear that California is just where he needed to be. His experience and expertise is invaluable to the success of 1st Priority.</p>
